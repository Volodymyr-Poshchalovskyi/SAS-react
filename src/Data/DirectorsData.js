    bio: 'Christopher Sims cut his teeth in the frenetic OC/LA skate and hardcore scene, where he wrote and directed a semi-autobiographical, no-budget feature before hitting the road with punk bands—shooting raw concert footage that he’d later shape into high-energy music docs and videos. That DIY spirit infused his transition into professional work, giving his visuals an edge and authenticity that quickly caught on.   Over the years, Sims has directed music videos for everyone from Usher, Ludacris and David Guetta to Avril Lavigne, Stone Temple Pilots, Keane and Ne-Yo, plus breakout artists like A Great Big World (feat. Christina Aguilera), Cassie and Noah Cyrus. Those clips have logged billions of views online. Early collaborations with legendary fashion duo Mert & Marcus sharpened his eye for style—and today you see that influence in commercials for Pepsi (VMAs), Miller’s live-concert Reload, HyperIce’s Launch (set to The Misfits) and Beats’ incendiary “Destroy Bad Sound” spot starring Serena Williams. Following creative stints at DNA (now Hound Content/Anonymous Content) and RSA Films, Sims now thrives as an independent commercial director and Senior Director of Content at HyperIce. His client list—Apple, Nike, Gucci, Citi, Deutsch, JWT, BBDO, VaynerMedia and Sea Shepherd—reflects a versatile career built on netic storytelling, fashion flair and unrelenting energy.',

    bio: 'Antony Hoffman is a Wild Gift–represented, award-winning director and director of photography whose work spans epic, large-scale productions and lean, “run-and-gun” shoots with intimate crews. Beginning his career documenting anti-apartheid uprisings for the AP and BBC in his native Cape Town, he carries the journalist’s curiosity into every commercial set—asking deep, strategic questions of agencies and brands to unearth the one coherent idea that gives a spot its narrative pulse. His storytelling has brought humanity and emotional truth to campaigns for Vodafone, Lamborghini, Audi, adidas, Peroni and the Budweiser “Clydesdales” Super Bowl spot now in MoMA’s permanent collection.Hoffman believes that true quality transcends budget or scale: some of his most celebrated work has been created with minimal resources, small crews and a relentless focus on craft. Whether pioneering multi-camera solutions on the fly to turn last-minute challenges into cinematic triumphs, or mentoring emerging filmmakers on set, he approaches every project with resilience, imagination and the conviction that “quality is quality,” no matter the format.',

Terrero, who is considered one of the most influential music video directors in urban culture, transitioned into film and TV with his first move being the cult classic SOUL PLANE, a film that marked the debut of comedian Kevin Hart and Sofia Vergara. His long-standing relationship with 50 Cent led him to direct a series of features in which the rap icon starred, including FREELANCERS with Robert De Niro and Forrest Whitaker; and GUN with Val Kilmer. Wanting to honor his heritage, Terrero started to focus his directing and producing efforts in the Latinx market, bringing with him the experience garnered in his previous projects. He created and directed the Netflix Original NICKY JAM: EL GANADOR. The success of the show led him to a blind deal with YouTube Originals, where he developed BRAVAS, an all-female cast series set in Puerto Rico. Under his production company, Cinema Giants, Jessy continues to develop stories for the international market as well as partnering with domestic buyers such as Showtime or Apple, where he currently has series in development and is attached to direct.',

    bio: 'TYD is a directing duo driven by story and emotion. Their signature style — what they call *refined authenticity* — blends realism with craft, creating films that feel intimate, grounded, and deeply human while still visually striking and elevated. From high-concept ideas to subtle emotional beats, TYD’s work is designed to connect — capturing the kind of moments that linger long after the screen fades to black. Their hands-on approach ensures creative cohesion at every stage: often shooting, editing, and grading their own work to preserve a singular vision from start to finish.  Collaboration is central to their process. TYD believes that the strongest work emerges from shared perspectives and collective creativity, whether they’re helming a large-scale commercial or a more personal, story-driven piece.',
