    bio: 'Christopher Sims cut his teeth in the frenetic OC/LA skate and hardcore scene, where he wrote and directed a semi-autobiographical, no-budget feature before hitting the road with punk bands—shooting raw concert footage that he’d later shape into high-energy music docs and videos. That DIY spirit infused his transition into professional work, giving his visuals an edge and authenticity that quickly caught on.   Over the years, Sims has directed music videos for everyone from Usher, Ludacris and David Guetta to Avril Lavigne, Stone Temple Pilots, Keane and Ne-Yo, plus breakout artists like A Great Big World (feat. Christina Aguilera), Cassie and Noah Cyrus. Those clips have logged billions of views online. Early collaborations with legendary fashion duo Mert & Marcus sharpened his eye for style—and today you see that influence in commercials for Pepsi (VMAs), Miller’s live-concert Reload, HyperIce’s Launch (set to The Misfits) and Beats’ incendiary “Destroy Bad Sound” spot starring Serena Williams. Following creative stints at DNA (now Hound Content/Anonymous Content) and RSA Films, Sims now thrives as an independent commercial director and Senior Director of Content at HyperIce. His client list—Apple, Nike, Gucci, Citi, Deutsch, JWT, BBDO, VaynerMedia and Sea Shepherd—reflects a versatile career built on netic storytelling, fashion flair and unrelenting energy.',

    bio: 'Jessy Terrero is a Dominican-American filmmaker and non-writing executive producer who first gained recognition for his work in the music video industry, creating iconic videos for artists such as Jennifer Lopez, 50 Cent, Enrique Iglesias, Daddy Yankee, Maluma, and Bad Bunny, amassing over 21 billion views collectively. Terrero, who is considered one of the most influential music video directors in urban culture, transitioned into film and TV with his first move being the cult classic SOUL PLANE, a film that marked the debut of comedian Kevin Hart and Sofia Vergara. His long-standing relationship with 50 Cent led him to direct a series of features in which the rap icon starred, including FREELANCERS with Robert De Niro and Forrest Whitaker; and GUN with Val Kilmer. Wanting to honor his heritage, Terrero started to focus his directing and producing efforts in the Latinx market, bringing with him the experience garnered in his previous projects. He created and directed the Netflix Original NICKY JAM: EL GANADOR. The success of the show led him to a blind deal with YouTube Originals, where he developed BRAVAS, an all-female cast series set in Puerto Rico. Under his production company, Cinema Giants, Jessy continues to develop stories for the international market as well as partnering with domestic buyers such as Showtime or Apple, where he currently has series in development and is attached to direct.',
