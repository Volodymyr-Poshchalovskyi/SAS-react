    bio: "Steve Pink's career as a writer, producer, and director is inextricably linked to his pal John Cusack. Pink co-wrote the screenplay for the 1997 black comedy 'Grosse Pointe Blank,' where Cusack played a deadpan assassin, and also worked on the adaptation of Nick Hornby's novel 'High Fidelity,' which was made into a film for Cusack in 2000. Pink had co-producer credits on both movies, and, in 2010, he finally directed Cusack in the '80s flashback comedy 'Hot Tub Time Machine.' Pink got his start as an actor in the Cusack movie 'The Sure Thing' in '85; he also appeared in 'Grosse Pointe Blank' and played a limo driver in the comedy 'America's Sweethearts,' where Cusack was paired with Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Fittingly, Pink has worked as a co-executive producer on the TV series 'Entourage,' a tribute to male friendship in show business, and he has stepped up as producer on the Tom Cruise vehicle 'Knight and Day.'",
